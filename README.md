Lyft Trip Data
In the Lyft Trip Data project on Codecademy's data science course, you will be working with real data provided by Lyft, a rideshare company. The data consists of information on individual trips taken using the Lyft app, including the date and time of the trip, the distance traveled, the amount charged, and various other details.

Your goal in this project is to use data analysis and visualization techniques to explore and understand the data, and to extract insights and trends from the data. This might include finding patterns in the data, such as identifying the most popular times and locations for rides, or identifying trends in the prices charged for rides. 

This project was completed using SQLite.
